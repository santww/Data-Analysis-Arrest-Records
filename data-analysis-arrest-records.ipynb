Through this analysis, we aim to:\n","- Understand the distribution of arrests over time and across different areas of Chicago.\n","- Explore which types of crimes are most prevalent in different regions.\n","- Analyze the demographic breakdown of individuals arrested, focusing on age, gender, and race.\n","- Identify any patterns in the data that could suggest socioeconomic or policy-related implications.\n","\n","### **Structure of the Analysis**\n","The analysis is structured as follows:\n","1. **Data Preprocessing**: We'll clean the dataset, handle missing values, and ensure that the data is in the correct format for analysis.\n","2. **Key Questions and Answers**: A set of specific questions will be presented, and the answers will be shown using analysis and visualizations. This section includes:\n","    - Trends in arrests over time (daily, monthly, yearly).\n","    - The most common types of crimes and their frequency.\n","    - Demographic analysis of the arrested individuals.\n","3. **Conclusions**: A summary of the key findings and any significant patterns identified during the analysis.\n","\n","### Questions Addressed\n","Some of the key questions we aim to answer through this analysis include:\n","1. **How have arrest numbers changed over time in Chicago? Are there any seasonal or time-based trends in criminal activity?**\n","2. **Which types of crimes are most common in the city?**\n","3. **What are the most affected demographic groups in terms of race?**\n","\n","Each question will be addressed using code, visualizations, and detailed analysis."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-27T22:36:43.596140Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-27T22:36:43.595033Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-27T22:36:43.600893Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-27T22:36:43.599832Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-27T22:36:43.596095Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["#Libraries\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-27T23:35:34.914513Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-27T23:35:34.913701Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-27T23:35:34.924107Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-27T23:35:34.923273Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-27T23:35:34.914475Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Functions\n","def get_variable_types(dataframe):\n","    continuous_vars = []\n","    categorical_vars = []\n","\n","    for column in dataframe.columns:\n","        if dataframe[column].dtype == 'object':\n","            categorical_vars.append(column)\n","        else:\n","            continuous_vars.append(column)\n","\n","    return continuous_vars, categorical_vars\n","\n","# Plot the distribuition of a column\n","def plot_distribution(df, column):\n","    #
